  Praise the LORD,I thank God for the salvation of my soul, My name is Oluwayemisi S Emmanuel, My testimony goes does, by June his year I was asked from the embassy to pick up my passport, on my way to the embassy for the pick up, i heard a voice asking me the reason why I traveled often, and I told the voice to that GOD is in position to answer that, before I know it, i discovered i couldn't swallow properly, i was in the car with my spouse but couldn't tell him to avoid unnecessary panicking, eventually I was admitted to the hospital I spent three days there, it all looks as if I Will not made it, i was contemplating on this within me and trying to tell my eldest son that was with me how take good care of his siblings that GOD in HIS infinite mercy brought pastor Deola message, It all looked like what!! GOD, is this me you did this for, actually I don't suppose to be there as at of that time, because I was an out patient, something just prompted me to come over, how I even recognized her I didn't know, because she looked different entirely, to cut a long story short, i quickly keeled down while she shared some words of prayers with me, immediately I felt the anointing of GOD, and there was great release and I told her I will come back to testify. However, though after that encounter, there was still some challenges, but all I kept remembering was I Will come back and testify, brethren I am today still breathing, i was struck down but not destroyed, i was in the grave, but GOD in HIS infinite mercy brought me and my family out, let the living help me praise ye the LORD
